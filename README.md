# Life Trade

This is a plugin for Minecraft Paper Server.

You can think of it as a plugin *opposite to* **Life-Steal**.

In this plugin, the hearts of players is the currency.

You can get hearts by dealing with others.

You can also give your hearts to others in exchange for what you need.

Even sign an agreement.

At last, have a fun!
